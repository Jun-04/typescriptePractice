## About Me
Hi, I'm doing self studying front end, currently focused on learning React and TypeScript. Interested in web development, UI/UX design, and building nice projects. Feel free to contact me anytime.

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript（ES6+）
- TypeScript
- React / vite

## What I learned through this project-
- What is the benefit to use typescript for reactjs.
- For example, javascript can't reconige string or number( 1000 and "1000") so typescript can avoid that kind of bug.
